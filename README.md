# Question4
In October 2022, I enrolled with Getsmarter and the University of Cape Town for a Data Science with Python short course. 
I received my awesome certificate in April this year and the feeling was unmeasurable. 
During the course, I delt with Neural networks, Tree-based models, K-means and Hierarchical clustering. I’ve also participated in every group discussion and received a 100% as a reward. 
Module 8 was a real-life data science problem which I found challenging but because it was doable, I came back with 85%. 
As much as I fell in love for data science first, the challenges and techniques delt with in the data engineering field are something I would like to have experience of. 
After finishing the abovementioned course, I did ‘Understanding Data Engineering’ with DataCamp, ‘Python for beginners’ with Sololearn; both of which I already obtained online certificates for.
